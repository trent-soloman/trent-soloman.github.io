    <p><strong><em>What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important?</em></strong></p>
    <p>Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices (desktops, tablets, and phones).
      Responsive Web Design is about using CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What mobile first design is, and why it's important?</em></strong></p>
    <p>It allows faster load times on mobiles and less data usage and helps simplify the design of a site by designing the page for a mobile first.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons?</em></strong></p>
    <p>A framework is a standardized set of concepts, practices and criteria for
      dealing with a common type of problem, which can be used as a reference to help us approach and resolve new problems of a similar nature.
In the world of web design, to give a more straightforward definition, a framework is defined as a package made up of a structure of files
and folders of standardized code (HTML, CSS, JS documents etc.) which can be used to support the development of websites, as a basis to start building a site.
The advantages are it speeds up the mock-up process, clean and tidy code, solutions to common CSS problems, browser compatibility, learn good practices,
having a single procedure to resolve common problems makes maintaining various projects more straightforward, helpful in collaborative work.
The disadvantages are Mixes content and presentation, unused code leftover, slower learning curve, you donâ€™t learn to do it yourself</p>
    <p><strong><em>What a wireframe is and why we use it?</em></strong></p>
    <p>A website wireframe, also known as a page schematic or screen blueprint, is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.
      Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose.</p>
    <p><strong><em>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why?</em></strong></p>
    <p>I had difficulty making the image size responsive because the code did not seem to work.</p>
