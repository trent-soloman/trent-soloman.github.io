I and definitely in the kitchen/creator mindset rather than the restraunt talbe/consumerist mindset
because for me what we are owed in life is a deep philosophical question I don't have the answer to.
I am here to give it my best. I completely understand that EDA is young and improves over time.
I am worried that the rest of the cohort is smarter than me because I seem to be the only one
posting lots of questions on slack. I am aware I should not go down rabbit holes.
As much as I hate not knowing something, I'm not afraid to say I don't know something if
it means I might learn something. I am worried that despite EDA's intentions, the cohort
will be competitive. I am a little nervous about working in a team but lets see what happens.
