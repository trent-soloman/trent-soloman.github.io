<h2>Reflection Blog</h2>
<p class=colour> I and definitely in the kitchen/creator mindset rather than the restaurant table/consumerist mindset
because for me what we are owed in life is a deep philosophical question I don't have the answer to.</p>
<p>I am here to give it my best. I completely understand that EDA is young and improves over time.</p>
<p class=colour> I am worried that the rest of the cohort is smarter than me because I seem to be the only one
posting lots of questions on slack. I am aware I should not go down rabbit holes.</p>
<p id=intro> As much as I hate not knowing something, I'm not afraid to say I don't know something if
it means I might learn something.</p>
<div><p>I am worried that despite EDA's intentions, the cohort will be competitive.</p></div>
