<h1>Reflection</h1>
<p><strong><em>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</em></strong></p>
<p>I think it will be very enriching.</p>
<p><strong><em>What are your impressions?</em></strong></p>
<p>My impressions of the course are favourable.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am very much in the creator/kitchen mindset rather than the restaurant table/consumerism mindset.</p>
<p><strong><em>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</em></strong></p>
<p>My expectations of EDA have not changed at all.</p>
<p><strong><em>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</em></strong></p>
<p>I am very excited.I am a little bit nervous about working in a team, but let's see how it goes.</p>
