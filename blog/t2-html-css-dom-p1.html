    <p><strong><em>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?</em></strong></p>
    <p>The html is like the building and the css is like the interior decoration. The Dom is like a tree where you can pluck the leaves off and rearrange them in a different pattern.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What is meant by boxifying design?</em></strong></p>
      <p>Everything on the page can be broken up into different boxes. Sometimes there are boxes within boxes.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What is the box model?</em></strong></p>
    <p> The CSS box model is a box that wraps around each HTML element. It consists of margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.</p>
