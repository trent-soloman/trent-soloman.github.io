    <p><strong><em>What was the problem?</em></strong></p>
    <p>My javascript wasn't working for one of the assignments.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What problem solving techniques did you use?</em></strong></p>
    <p>I used a syntax checker. I came back to the problem later with a fresh mind.
      I asked for help from other students and teachers.</p>
    <p><strong><em>How did you feel throughout the process??</em></strong></p>
    <p>I was feeling confident that I would find the issue eventually.</p>
    <p><strong><em>What did you learn?</em></strong></p>
    <p>That spelling is something I should often check as well.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</em></strong></p>
    <p>I often do pseudocode and try different approaches. The rubber ducky method does not work for me.
    Googling can help but sometimes alot of time passes in solving problems this way and another method should
    be employed if googling isn't fruitful within a certain time period. I am not afraid to ask
    peers and teachers for help but I am aware I need to try solve the problem myself first.</p>
    <p><strong><em>Using the JS Array docs as a starting point, describe what these functions do in your own words:</em></strong></p>
    <p>The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
      The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
    The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.</p>
