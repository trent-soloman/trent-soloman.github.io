    <p>I have tried meditation in the past and while I can't deny it works for some people, it
      just doesn't work for me. I find it painful and unproductive. I am happy and productive
      when my mind is constantly thinking or absorbing.</p>
    <p> I have always believed that confidence comes from ability and that it's not the other
      way around like some people say. </p>
    <p> I see the virtue of starting small.</p>
